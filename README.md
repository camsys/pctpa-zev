# Welcome to the PCTPA ZEV Infrastructure Siting Analysis Tool
`Placer County Transportation Planning Agency`

This tool is developed as part of the Placer County Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Infrastructure Plan: https://www.pctpa.net/zev . The plan has the goal to provide strategic guidance for the deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure across Placer County. 

To support this, the tool is designed to help evaluate candidate sites (parcels) for ZEV public refueling infrastructure (EV charging or hydrogen refueling) for both light-duty and medium-/heavy-duty vehicles. The evaluation is based on multiple groups of siting criteria, including utilization, land availability, equity, grid capacity, and environmental conditions. Sites that do not meet minimum requirements (exclusionary criteria), such as insufficient land area or incompatible land use, are excluded from further analysis. All remaining parcels are scored on a 0–10 scale, with higher scores reflecting more favorable conditions. The map displays these parcel-level scores. 

This tool is intended as a planning resource and does not prescribe where chargers or hydrogen stations should automatically be deployed. Parcel scoring provides a comparative evaluation but does not replace the need for site-specific assessments. Additional considerations such as detailed utility capacity assessments, permitting constraints, local community input and other local conditions will be necessary to be evaluated before making any siting decisions.
